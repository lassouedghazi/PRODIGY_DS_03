Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. Use a dataset such as the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository




# 🌟 Prodigy Info Tech Internship - Task 3: Predictive Modeling Mastery

## 🚀 Introduction

Welcome to my third project at Prodigy Info Tech! In this task, I’m taking a deep dive into the world of machine learning by building a decision tree classifier. The goal is to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. I’ll be using the Bank Marketing dataset, a well-known dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which is rich with information and perfect for this task.

## 📁 Dataset Overview

The dataset I’m working with is the "Bank Marketing" dataset, which provides a wealth of information about customers, including their demographic characteristics, past marketing interactions, and more. This dataset is pivotal for building a predictive model that can help businesses understand customer behavior and improve marketing strategies.

### Dataset Highlights:

- **Variables:** The dataset includes features such as age, job, marital status, education, balance, and more.
- **Objective:** To predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service, which is captured in the target variable `y`.

## 🎯 Project Goals

### Classification Focus:

For this task, I will build a decision tree classifier to predict the target variable `y`, which indicates whether a customer will make a purchase (`yes` or `no`). The model will be trained on a variety of features, including:

- **Age:** How does age influence the likelihood of making a purchase?
- **Job:** Are certain professions more inclined to purchase?
- **Balance:** Does a higher account balance correlate with purchase behavior?

### Key Features:

- **High Accuracy:** The model will be fine-tuned to achieve high accuracy, ensuring reliable predictions.
- **Interpretability:** Decision trees are known for their interpretability, allowing us to understand the decision-making process of the model.
- **Visual Appeal:** The final decision tree will be visualized, providing a clear and insightful representation of the decision-making process.

## 💻 Tools and Technologies

To bring this project to life, I’ll be leveraging a combination of powerful tools:

- **Python 🐍:** The backbone of this project, enabling powerful data manipulation and modeling.
- **Scikit-learn 📊:** A robust machine learning library for building and evaluating the decision tree classifier.
- **Pandas & NumPy 📈:** For data preprocessing and manipulation.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn 🎨:** For data visualization, including the visual representation of the decision tree.
- **Jupyter Notebook 📓:** To document the process, experiment with models, and share findings interactively.

## 🎯 Deliverables

- **Decision Tree Classifier:** A well-trained and optimized decision tree model that predicts customer purchase behavior.
- **Model Evaluation:** Detailed metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and a confusion matrix.
- **Decision Tree Visualization:** A visual representation of the decision tree, highlighting the most important features and decision paths.
- **In-Depth Analysis:** An analysis explaining the decision tree's performance, key insights from the model, and potential business implications.

## 🔥 Conclusion

This project marks a significant step in my internship at Prodigy Info Tech, where I’m honing my skills in predictive modeling and data analysis. Through this task, I aim to deliver a robust and interpretable model that can provide valuable insights into customer behavior.

Stay tuned for the final results – where data science meets business intelligence!
